    "Reproducible reports are reports where automation is used to update a report when changes to data or data analysis methods lead to changes in data analysis artifacts (e.g., figures, tables, inline text values). This automation is usually specified and controlled by code. In the field of data science, the most common implementations of this are: \n",

    "> Note: R Markdown and Jupyter are not completely separable from LaTeX, as they both wrap LaTeX when the desired output is PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most implementations of reproducible reports involve a process called rendering, where a document containing code and/or markup language used to specify the text formatting, document layout, figure and table placement and numbering, bibliography formatting, *etc*, is converted to an output more suitable for consumption (e.g., beautifully formatted PDF or html document) by some software.\n",

WYSIWYG reports are typically easier to get started with and use. However, they are usually quite limited in their ability to automatically update a report when changes to data or data analysis methods lead to changes in data analysis artifacts. This makes them less reproducible, and can lead to errors when repeated manual updating of data analysis artifacts is needed when analysis is iterated on during development. \n",

    ">     The value of `x` is currently `r x`.\n",

    "> - Latex equations can be written the same way as in Jupyter notebooks\n",

    ">       - When hovering over equations,\n",
    ">         R will display the rendered equation in a pop up.\n",

    ">   is a great exhaustive resource for looking up anything Markdown related.\n",
    "> - One of the features made available thanks to Pandoc\n",
    ">   is support for citations and bibliographies.\n",

    ">       and copying the BibTex citation into a new document\n",
    ">       that we call `rstudio-demo.bib \n",
    ">       and adding an identifier string (a key) before the first comma,\n",
    ">       e.g. `r-lang`.\n",

    ">       in the beginning of the document: `bibliography: rstudio-demo.bib`,\n",
    ">       then cite it somewhere in the text by adding `[@r-lang]`.\n",
