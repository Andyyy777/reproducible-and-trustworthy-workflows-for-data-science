    "\n",
    "Before we can fully define containers, however, we need to define **virtualization**. Virtualization is a process that allows us to divide the the elements of a single computer into several virtual elements. These elements can include computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources, and even operating system user spaces (e.g., graphical tools, utilities, and programming languages). \n",
    "\n",
    "Containers virtualize operating system user spaces so that they can isolate the processes they contain, as well as control the processes’ access to computer resources (e.g., CPUs, memory and desk space). What this means in practice, is that an operating system user space can be carved up into multiple containers running the same, or different processes, in isolation. Below we show the schematic of a container whose virtual user space contains the:\n",

With virtual machine the virtualization occurs at the layer of software that sits between the computer's hardware and the operating system(s). This software is called a hypervisor. For example, on a Mac laptop, you could install a program called [Oracle Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/) to run a virtual machine whose operating system was Windows 10, as the screen shot below shows:\n",

    "Navigate to the directory where you mounted your files via: `cd /home/my_mounted_volume` and type `ls` to ensure you can see them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: if you are mounting volumes to a container from a Docker image that runs a web app, be sure to read the documentation to see where you should mount that volume. Usually the web apps are only exposed to certain directories and you will only be able to access the files in the mounted volume if you mount them to the correct place. For example, in the `rocker/rstudio` image that we loaded earlier, volumes need to be mounted within `/home/rstudio/` to be able to access them via the RStudio server web app.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows notes for mounting volumes:\n",

    "If we want to use a graphical user interface (GUI) with our containers, for example to be able to use the computational environment in the container in an integrated development environment (IDE) such as RStudio or JupyterLab, then we need to map the correct port from the container to a port on our computer.\n",

    "To do this, we use the `-p` flag with `docker run`, specifying the port in the container on the left-hand side, and the port on your computer (the container/Docker host) on the right-hand side of `:`. For example, to run the `rocker/rstudio` container image we would type `-p 8787:8787` to map the ports as shown in the `docker run` command below:\n",

Meanwhile rocker/tidyverse:latest will always have both the latest R version and latest versions of the R packages, built nightly.\n",
