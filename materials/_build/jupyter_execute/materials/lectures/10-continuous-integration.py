# ## Topic learning objectives
# 
# By the end of this topic, students should be able to:

# 1. Argue the costs and benefits of using automated test infrastructure
# 2. Use a testing framework (e.g., `testhat`) to automate the running of a
# project's entire test suite
# 3. Use a continuous integration (e.g., GitHub Actions) to automate the running of the
# test suite using the testing framework
# 4. Incorporate non-code-functionality tests such as style/format checkers into a testing
# pipeline
