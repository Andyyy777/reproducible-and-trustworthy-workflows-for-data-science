    "Using wild cards and pattern matching in a makefile is possible, but the syntax is not very readable. So if you choose to do this proceed with caution. Example of how to do this are here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/05-patterns/index.html\n",

    "As for variables in a Makefile, in most cases we actually do not want to do this. The reason is that we want this file to be a record of what we did to run our analysis (e.g., what files were used, what settings were used, etc). If you start using variables with your Makefile, then you are shifting the problem of recording how your analysis was done to another file. There needs to be some file in your repo that captures what variables were called so that you can replicate your analysis. Examples of using variables in a Makefile are here: http://swcarpentry.github.io/make-novice/06-variables/index.html"
