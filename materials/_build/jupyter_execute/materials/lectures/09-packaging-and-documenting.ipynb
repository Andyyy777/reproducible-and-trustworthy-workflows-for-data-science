    "> It depends on your level of patience for violating the DRY principle, for me the magic number is about 3. If I repeat writing code within a single script or notebook, on the third try hair starts to stand up on the back of my neck and I am irritated sufficiently to either write a funciton or a loop. The same goes with copying files containing functions that I would like to re-use. The third time that I do this, I am convinced that I will likely want to use this code again on another project and thus I should package it to make my life easier. \n",

Doing this can be viewed as an act of altruism that also provides you professional gain by putting your data science skills on display (and padding your CV!).\n",

    "\n",
    "This new single configuration file has inspired some new tools to be created in the package building and management ecosystem in Python. One of the most recent and simplest to use is Poetry (created in 2018). When used to build packages, Poetry roughly does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Uses the `pyproject.toml` to manage and solve package configurations via the Poetry commands `init`, `add`, `config`, etc\n",
    "\n",
