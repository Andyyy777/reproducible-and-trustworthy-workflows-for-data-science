Below we show the schematic of a container whose virtual user space contains the:\n",

With virtual machine the virtualization occurs at the layer of software that sits between the computer's hardware and the operating system(s). This software is called a hypervisor.

Usually the web apps are only exposed to certain directories and you will only be able to access the files in the mounted volume if you mount them to the correct place. For example, in the `rocker/rstudio` image that we loaded earlier, volumes need to be mounted within `/home/rstudio/` to be able to access them via the RStudio server web app.\n",

And the path must be formatted like: `C:\\Users\\tiffany.timbers\\Documents\\project\\:/home/project`"
